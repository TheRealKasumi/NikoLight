					<p>
						Here a system update can be installed to the TesLight controller. This includes the firmware of the
						mcu as well as the user interface. To install a system update, you first need to download a so called
						"TesLight Update Package". These files have the extension ".tup" and can be found in the release
						section on my Github page:
						<br />
						<br />
						https://github.com/TheRealKasumi/TesLight
						<br />
						<br />
						After the download, please use this page to upload the update package to the controller. Once the file
						is uploaded, the controller will restart and install the update. This can take up to 2 minutes but
						usually is faster. During this time, the controller will not be reachable via the WiFi hotspot. Please
						be patient. Afterwards the controller will restart and become reachable as usual.
						<br />
						<br />
						But here is also a word of warning. Uploading broken update packages could make the controller
						unreachable. Then a wired connection to reinstall the firmware is required. So it is recommended to
						only upload stable and tested update packages from the Github page.
					</p>
